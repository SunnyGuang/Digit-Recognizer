# Digit Recognizer

## Introduction:
Digit Recognizer is the basic project for Deep Learning. It exsits 42,000 training data. Because it is the Kaggle entry level project. The dataset is also not complex, and I do not need to improve the dataset again. I need to convert 28*28 image to the matrix for training, and I need to build the model to train.
I will try to use python and Deep learning (CNN) to build the algorithm that could detect the objects of the images.

## Platform
Windows 10 system
Kernals in Kaggle.com

## Why do I choose this project?
I want to learn python and machine learning through the project, to have better understanding for machine learning and expert to use python after I finish the project.

## Instructions:
- This program is a Convolutional Neural Network design by python to identify digit recognizer. It loads the input dataset and perform by running the code, does not require the test code.
- Runing the code need to using jupyter notebook. It also need some python package such as matplotlib and keras.
- Step one: git clone the code to the local PC, using "git clone + repo_link"
- Step two: using juypter notebook to open the Python Project.ipynb file.
- Step three: use pip install + package_name to install the required packages
- Step four: run the code
- Result picture shows in "_result_files" folder
