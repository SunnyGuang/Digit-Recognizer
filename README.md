## Object-Detection-Track

# Introduction:
Google AI posted the competition which hope people build an algotithm that is able to automatically detects objects by using an absolutly massive train dataset.
I will try to use python and machine learning to build the algorithm that could detect the objects of the images.

# Why do I choose this project?
I want to learn python and machine learning through the project. Except to have better understanding for machine learning and expert to use python after I finish the project.
