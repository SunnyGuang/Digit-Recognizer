# Digit Recognizer

## Introduction:
Digit Recognizer is the basic project for Deep Learning. It exsits 42,000 training data. Because it is the Kaggle entry level project. The dataset is also not complex, and I do not need to improve the dataset again. I need to convert 28*28 image to the matrix for training, and I need to build the model to train.
I will try to use python and Deep learning (CNN) to build the algorithm that could detect the objects of the images.

## Platform
Windows 10 system
Kernals in Kaggle.com

## Why do I choose this project?
I want to learn python and machine learning through the project, to have better understanding for machine learning and expert to use python after I finish the project.
